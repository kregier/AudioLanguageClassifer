# AudioLanguageClassifer

# Introduction
The current project aims to develop deep ML models that can classify input audio files based on speaker sex (male or female) and identify the native language of speakers who produce English sentences (following a script or prompt). Given the large number of languages in the world, the model will focus on the top 10 languages from the training dataset.
# The Data
The data is from the Speech Accent Archive, available at https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/speech-accent-archive. 
The archive contains audio recordings of speakers reading a fixed passage in English, as well as demographic information about the speakers (native langauge, birthplace, country, age, sex).
## Audio file processing
## Feature extraction
Feature extraction will be done initially using the pre-trained vggish model.
# The Models
## Speaker sex
## Native language
